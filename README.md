<h1>Interactive comments section</h1>
<p>Live: https://lindllay.github.io/interactive-comments-section-main/</p>



Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.



### Expected behaviour

- First-level comments should be ordered by their score, whereas nested replies are ordered by time added.
- Replying to a comment adds the new reply to the bottom of the nested replies within that comment.
- A confirmation modal should pop up before a comment or reply is deleted.
- Adding a new comment or reply uses the `currentUser` object from within the `data.json` file.
- You can only edit or delete your own comments and replies.

<h4>This project is my implementation of frontendmentor.io guru's level challenge. It's a typical e-commerce website, where users are able to:</h4>
<ul>
<li>search for audio equipment, categorized in 3 groups: headphones, speakers and earphones, one sub-page for each group</li>
<li>check details of every item;</li>
<li>add/remove products from the cart;</li>
<li>keep track of what's in the cart, even after refreshing the browser</li>
<li>fill in all fields in the checkout form and receive form validations if fields are missed or incorrect;</li>
<li>see correct checkout totals depending on the products in the cart</li>
<li>receive an order confirmation modal after checking out with an order summary</li>
</ul>
