<h4>This project is my implementation of frontendmentor.io intermediate level challenge. It is a facebook-like interactive comment section, where user can:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies</li>
<li>Upvote and downvote comments</li>
<li>Dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted</li>
<li>See first-level comments ordered by their score, whereas nested replies ordered by time added</li>
<li>Save current state in the browser, that persists when the browser is refreshed</li>
<li>See hover states for all interactive elements on the page</li>
</ul>

Layout is optimalized for the app depending on device's screen size

Built with:
<strong>JS, SCSS, HTML, Figma</strong>
